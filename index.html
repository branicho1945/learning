<p></p>
Elmina Castle was erected by the Portuguese in 1482 as Castelo de São Jorge da Mina (St. George of the Mine Castle),<br>
First established as a trade settlement, the castle later became one of the most important stops on the route of the Atlantic slave trade.<br>
<br>The Gold Coast, which is now Ghana, gained its independence in 1957 from Britain, and had control of the castle.<br>
<br>Trade between Elmina and Portugal grew throughout the decade following the establishment of the trading post under Gomes.<br>
In 1481, the recently crowned João II decided to build a fort on the coast in order to ensure the protection of this trade,<br>
 which was once again held as a royal monopoly. <br>
 King João sent all of the materials needed to build the fort on ten caravels and two transport ships.<br>
 <br> The supplies, which included everything from heavy foundation stones to roof tiles, were sent, in pre-fitted form, along with provisions for six hundred men.<br>
  <br>Under the command of Diogo de Azambuja, the fleet set sail on 12 December 1481 and arrived at Elmina, in a village called Of Two Parts<br>

            Kumasi (historically spelled Comassie or Coomassie and usually spelled Kumase in Twi)<br>
            is a city in Ashanti Region, and is among the largest Metropolitan areas in Ghana. <br>
           <br> Kumasi is approximately 500 kilometres (300 mi) north of the Equator and 200 kilometres (100 mi) north of the Gulf of Guinea.<br>
            It is also called Oseikrom (Osei Tutu's town). Kumasi is the second largest city in Ghana, after the capital, Accra.<br>
           <br> There is evidence that the area around Kumasi has been kept cleared since the Neolithic age and that the first human settlement was at Lake Bosomtwe.<br>
            <center><h3>Asanteman</h3></center>
            The city rose to prominence in 1695 when it became capital of the Ashanti Confederacy due to the activities of its ruler Osei Tutu.<br>
                 The ruler of Kumasi, known as the Asantehene, also served as ruler of the Confederacy, <br>
                 with their 1701 victory over Denkyira the Asante confederacy became the primary state among the Ashantis.<br>
                  Parts of the city, including the then royal residence, were destroyed by British troops in the Third Anglo-Ashanti War of 1874<br>
